You can send a quick email, have your email read to you, create a reminder to look at an email later, search for email, and more. Here are some examples of what you can say to Siri:</p><ul><li><p><span class="SaytoSiri">“Send an email to John about our travel plans”</span></p></li><li><p><span class="SaytoSiri">“Read my email”</span></p></li><li><p><span class="SaytoSiri">“Remind me about this in an hour”</span></p></li><li><p><span class="SaytoSiri">“Find emails about kitchen remodel”</span></p></li></ul></div><div id="mlhl2ff39ce2" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Filters</h2><p>Quickly find emails in a mailbox by <a href="mlhl1f6cf15a.html#mlhl1f6cf15a" class="xRef AppleTopic">using filters</a> to change which messages are shown. For example, apply a filter to show only unread messages or those with attachments—or messages that meet both criteria. You can apply up to six filters.</p></div><div id="mlhldc95f065" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Conversations</h2><p><a href="mail35700.html#mail35700" class="xRef AppleTopic">Conversations are streamlined</a>—the subject line is shown only at the top of the conversation, instead of in each message—so they’re easier to read.</p><p>If you’re new to Mail, the most recent message in a conversation is shown at the bottom, so you can follow the thread from the first message down to the latest. Otherwise, the order of messages in conversations remains unchanged from when you used Mail in OS X v10.11.</p></div><div id="mlhl5c9e04c1" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Accounts preferences</h2><p><a href="mlhl075989ef.html#mlhl075989ef" class="xRef AppleTopic">Accounts preferences</a> in Mail have been reorganized, so it’s easier to find options you might change more frequently, such as email aliases or how to handle attachments. Options for the junk, trash, and other mailboxes have been consolidated.</p></div><div id="mlhl0ef7e541" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Other features</h2><ul><li><p>For Exchange accounts, Mail automatically checks for new messages if the account’s mail server uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) streaming notifications.</p></li><li><p>If you use multiple email accounts, Mail can help ensure that you use the intended From address when you send a message, based on the email address of your first recipient in the To field. For example, if your preferred email address (in Composing preferences) is your personal Gmail address but you’re writing an email to your professor at their school address (.edu), Mail uses your school address instead of your personal address in the From field.</p></li><li><p>If you set the option (in Viewing preferences) to move discarded messages to the Archive mailbox, you can archive messages directly from Mail notifications.</p></li><li><p>You can use tabs in Mail windows, even when you’re not using Mail full screen.</p></li><li><p>Mail helps you optimize storage space on your Mac by providing an option (in Accounts preferences) to specify which attachments—all, recent, or none—to automatically download when you read email.</p></li></ul></div><div class="LinkUniversal"><strong>SEE ALSO</strong><a href="mlhl00c9f230.html#mlhl00c9f230" class="xRef AppleTopic">Mail overview</a><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mac-apps/mail/" class="URL">Apple Support Mail website</a></div></body></html>
