### Where Files Should be Installed ###

#### AppleScript ####

For sandboxed Word 2016, we're required to place files in the following path

* `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Word/`

For consistency, we're also going to place scripts in the same location for 2011


#### Word Macro Templates ####

For 2011

* `/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Startup/Word/`

For 2016

* `~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates/`
