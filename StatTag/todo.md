1) Fix date parsing - still odd issues with times w/o dates pulling incorrect timezone
2) Change all inner members to _variable notation and fix property mappings
3) Fix all error handlers - currently returning nils
4) Set all atomic/retain/etc. options for each property (readonly) (nonatomic) (strong) (copy) etc.
   - (copy) string
   - (strong, nonatomic) array, date
   _ (strong, nonatomic) any other child model item
